Discussion on graphs R buddy
Date: 2.5.2023

Next date: 25. Mai 8.15 - 11.15
topics ideas: 
* tidyverse: how to merge, subset, make new columns etc
* loops and how to avoid loops
* version control on git

--> we take version control

Students present: Zephir, Sara Hoefer, Sarah Gauss, Tatjana, Sophie

Why do we create graphs?
* identify trends & relationships between variables, get an overview
* compare data
* detect outliers (boxplots, scatterplots with plot-function in base R, cooks distance) - if you kick outliers out, give reasons (biological reason?)
* communicate results / transmit main messages
* simplify things for an understanding of the data / results
* communicate results, make them accessible for other people, non-researchers

What should we consider to plot meaningfully?
* identify purpose of the graph (which message do we want to show?)
* choose right chart type
* inclusive color palette (e.g R-charts.com/colors -> there you can just copy it)
* keep it simple (not too many colors, avoid redundancy, not too much ink,
  avoid 3d, ...)
* labels, no abbreviations
* include units
* scale axes (so that all the data is included and fills the whole graph)
...

Bad graphs:
* shrinking family doctor: they want to show that there is a decreasing doctor/population
ratio over time...time scale is misleading (not continuous), .. size of doctors irritates
* new york state total budget: 3d confusing, too much ink
* SD elevation (abbreviation), Richness of what? .. I would use colors instead of different
shapes because I can't distinguish them.. over all / main relationship / trendline?
* axes labels: for factors I would directly indicate the meaning and not zero/one (here e.g protected/non-protected)
... right plot: why are blue dots not labeled - why not all red dots labeled? difficult to see to which dot which label belongs
.... ugly
* Distribution of AM fungi: too many abbreviations, no over all trend detectable, too much information
... personally I have always difficulties with continuous color palettes; here I would prefer to have
three levels of abundances and occurrences... otherwise I'm confused because there are too many details.. i would
put the details in a table so that the ones who are interested can have a look
* LUI: too many variables! I can not see the relationships between the single variables in the middle and the cate
gories on the left. No one except us understands LUI
* Root functional traits; too many abbreviations on y-axes. 
* Relationships btw community dissimilarities: can't identify the shapes
... abbreviations are not even described in the capture
* What about this one? I like the drawings but I have difficulties with understanding the brown circles...
.. CWM, do all understand this? ... main message not clear, too complex


Comments on Exercise 1 and 2:
* transpose data: pivot function from tidyverse, verry useful (pivot_longer or pivot_wider). You can define new columns and say which variables 
should be in rows or columns. for the iris dataset code example: see R Markdown file from this R buddy session

* save plot with e.g ggsave() from cowplot package -> save plot with ggsave function (or another function) allows
to fully reproduce the plot, also if data has changed (in contrast to manually extract a pdf of the plot)
* sjplot also has a save function where you can adjust the single plot sizes
* ggeffects package and sjplot packages useful to plot model estimates and summary stats tables
* "wesanderson" package for special colors
* how to insert p-values and stars: check ggplot tutorial
