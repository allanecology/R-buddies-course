  - what is the purpose when we are plotting data? (data overview vs
    graphs for papers) –\> graphs should transmit main messages,
    simplify things, help to understand complex things, show direction
    and strength of relationships… what makes a good graph? –\> reduce
    redundancy, colors, labels, avoid abbreviations, … discuss bad
    graphs (see file attached)
