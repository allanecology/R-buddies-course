# Session organisation

## Session Schedule

- 14.00-14.20: Discussion on plotting (all)
  - what is the purpose when we are plotting data? (data overview vs graphs for papers)
    --> graphs should transmit main messages, simplify things, help to understand complex things, show direction and strength of relationships...
    what makes a good graph? --> reduce redundancy, colors, labels, avoid abbreviations, ...
    discuss bad graphs (see file attached)

- 14.20-15.10: work individually or in small groups
    - Exercise 1 and 2 (see last slide in attached file)
    - Noelle : including everyone to our ILIAS folder who wants to get ECTS

- 15.10 - 15.30: break

- 15.30-16.15: work individually or in small groups

- 16.15-16.45: 
  - Exchange/present graphs from Exercises
  - discuss problems, things we learned, discuss maybe base R versus ggplot2

- 16.45-17.00:
  - Who of you would like to get ECTS and would do a written/ oral summary?
    - Did all of those register to the ILIAS folder?
  - find date for last session : Student presentations in week of 29th May - 2. June
      - Maja not here : Tuesday morning
  - find topic (I could prepare something on trait space visualization but only if students are interested in this topic)

# Discussion on graphs R buddy
Date: 2.5.2023

Why do we create graphs?
* identify trends & relationships between variables
* compare data
* detect outliers
* communicate results / transmit main messages
* simplify things for an understanding of the data / results
...

What should we consider to plot meaningfully?
* identify purpose of the graph (which message do we want to show?)
* choose right chart type
* keep it simple (not too many colors, avoid redundancy, not too much ink,
  avoid 3d, ...)
* labels, no abbreviations
* include units
* scale axes (so that all the data is included and fills the whole graph)
...
