# How to download a single file from GitHub?

1.  Find the file on GitHub and click on it.
2.  click the "Raw" button at the top of the file. A new tab will open, showing you a raw (a very ugly) version of the file.
3.  Select "Save Link As ..." or "Save Page As ..." (depending on your browser) and chose the location where to store.
    -   We recommend to save it with the same name as the original, potentially adding your initials in the end, e.g. "tutorial_mixed_models_NS.Rmd" if your initals are "NS"
